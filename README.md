# Practice With Github and Submitting Your First Assignment

The goal of this exercise is to get more practice with Git and Github and to get your feet wet with Github Classroom.

Here are your instructions:

## Getting the repo

When you accepted this assigment, Github Classroom made a repo for you. You want to 'clone' it onto the machine your working on. Here are the steps:

1. ```cd``` into the directory where you want this new repo to live (Desktop is a good place)
2. Find and click the 'Clone or Download' button
3. Copy the link or click the Clipboard button on the right (this copies the link to your clipboard)
4. Run `git clone <pasted url>`
5. cd into the cloned repository
6. Open it in Atom

4. Check your work with ```git status```
5. Use git commands to push that file to your repo on Github

## Challenge 2: Adding your solutions

2. In ```js-day-2.js``` add your code from today's challenges
3. Use git commands to add and commit your file
4. Check your work with ```git status```
